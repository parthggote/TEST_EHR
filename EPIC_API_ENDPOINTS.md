## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Core Clinical Enhancement
1. Add DiagnosticReport endpoints for comprehensive lab results
2. Implement Procedure endpoints for surgical/medical procedures
3. Add Immunization tracking
4. Enhance clinical documentation with DocumentReference

### Phase 2: Care Coordination
1. Implement CarePlan and Goal management
2. Add Provider and Organization lookup
3. Enhance appointment booking capabilities
4. Add patient communication features

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Implement bulk data operations for analytics
2. Add clinical decision support hooks
3. Integrate patient questionnaires
4. Add financial/billing information

## Security Considerations

All endpoints should implement:
- OAuth 2.0 with PKCE authentication
- Proper scope validation
- Audit logging for PHI access
- Rate limiting and retry logic
- Encryption for sensitive data storage

## Testing Strategy

For each endpoint:
1. Unit tests with mock data
2. Integration tests with Epic sandbox
3. Error handling validation
4. Performance testing
5. Security testing

## Next Steps

1. Choose endpoints from High Priority list
2. Update Epic client with new methods
3. Create corresponding API routes
4. Add TypeScript types
5. Implement UI components
6. Add comprehensive testing

Would you like me to implement any specific endpoints from this list?
